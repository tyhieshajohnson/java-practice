public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}

//Notes:
//1. Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. 
//In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.

//2. The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.

//The main Method
//a. The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:
//public static void main(String[] args)
//Any code inside the main() method will be executed.

//System.out.printIn()
//Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:
//public static void main(String[] args) {
//  System.out.println("Hello World");
//}
